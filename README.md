# JavaScript Loops, Arrays, and Objects Practice Assessment

As the name implies, this assessment is meant to be used as practice for the JavaScript Loops, Arrays, and Objects Assessment. I tried to create questions that are similar to, but not duplicates of, the questions in the real assessment's various branches. Please feel free to make branches of this practice to suit your cohort's upcoming real assessment.

If you don't intend to do an in-class walkthrough of this practice exam for your cohort, I encourage you to record a video of you solving it and make it available to your students.
